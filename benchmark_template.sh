## note: 
#    * ensure the cloudproto.pem is in the same folder as this script
#    * this script catches no wrong configurations or monitor whether all commands are executed successfully, you may log into ec2 and fix upcomming errors by yourself. 
#    * topology modifications or configurations at the components (e.g. frequency, metrics, ..) you must change manually in the compose file
#    * give your modified compose file a unique name
#    * if you run multiple benchmarks on the same swarm (we should not do that! ), then change the stackname "benchmark" to a unique name
#    * add your benchmark modifications add the step after the stack was deployed ( commented section below)

### examples 

## change the scaling to simulate failures (be aware of the correct service groups 
## u=0
## ssh -i "cloudproto.pem" docker@$ec2 "docker service scale benchmark_sensorGroupA=$u benchmark_sensorGroupB=$u benchmark_sensorGroupC=$u benchmark_sensorGroupD=$u"

## run database queries
echo 'Exporting database'
# put you cql query in a separate file
cqlsh $ec2 9042 --cqlversion="3.4.4" -f query.cql > "Benchmark_${topofilepath%%.*}".csv

## run the benchmark after modificatons further time?
## sleep $time

echo "Removing the Stack Topology: $topofile"
ssh -i "cloudproto.pem" docker@$ec2 "docker stack rm benchmark"
